# What Is This?

Inspired by [ribbonfarm.com](http://www.ribbonfarm.com), the Be Slightly Evil mailing list, and numerous discussions that have sprung from both, I started tinkering with designing MtG-inspired cards that would ideally introduce people to a person or idea through a judiciously chosen quote and a mechanic that illustrated the concept. The result was Be Slightly Evil: two sets of 250 cards, plus 20 basic lands and tokens, expressing persons and ideas from modern politics, philosophy, psychology, business, economics and technology.
 
The rules are borrowed wholesale from the popular Magic: the Gathering card game. There are some new mechanics present here (Clueless, Interchangeable, Surveil in the first set, Bid and Retaliate in the second) but otherwise keywords work here exactly as they do normally. Geek & Sundry has a [good introduction](http://geekandsundry.com/forums/discussion/4871/a-beginners-guide-to-magic-the-gathering/p1) to the game.
 
For obvious reasons, this is not a commercial project. This project is wholly unofficial and unauthorized, and for personal use only. I've tried to cite artists wherever possible, although in many cases the places I found the images failed to cite the origin of the image; in those instances I've listed the artist as Source Unknown.
 
Even though the block is still changing almost daily, most cards are stable and the sets as a whole should be quite playable. I hope you find this entertaining and that it exposes you to persons and ideas that you find curious and compelling.

# How do I play?

At present I have the only physical versions in my possession; however, all is not lost! Be Slightly Evil may be played online using Cockatrice.

In order to do so on Microsoft Windows, you will need to download [Cockatrice](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ouewghrnudatfid/AADPq-_buDYxG2zNJTDehw1ra?dl=0) (you may also need the Microsoft runtimes, which are provided in a subfolder at the link), and additionally the BSE Preset.rar file.

If you're on OS X / Linux, installation instructions for Cockatrice can be found [here](https://github.com/Cockatrice/Cockatrice/wiki/Installing-Cockatrice).
 
Use [WinRAR](http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm) to extract [BSE Preset.rar](https://www.dropbox.com/s/hdgbodjmtehegi8/BSE%20Preset.rar?dl=0) to:
 
%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Cockatrice\
 
(you may need to create this directory first). This will produce a subfolder also called Cockatrice, a cards.xml file with BSE and BSE2 pre-loaded, and Cockatrice-compatible images of all cards.
 
Also included are six prebuilt decks. I'll be releasing more decks in the next week or two.
 
In order to play online, you'll need to [register an account](http://www.woogerworks.com/index.php/account-registration). Once you have an account, connect to a [server](http://www.woogerworks.com/index.php/hosted-service-information/3-cockatrice-server-information) and start a game! For help with Cockatrice, see this [subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cockatrice/). To find players, ask on this [reddit thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/custommagic/comments/2pisvg/be_slightly_evil_a_ribbonfarminspired_mtg_block/) or ask on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hewhocutsdown) and mention @hewhocutsdown and #bse.

# How can I assist?

Playtesting and finding perverse combos that break the game would be the biggest help. Please note that this block is not intended to be used with any 'real' MtG cards: explaining that such-and-such a card is broken in the context of such-and-such official set will be ignored: tell me how it's broken here.
 
I'm still in the process of balancing the second set, but suggestions here are also welcome.
 
Otherwise, if you find typos, unclear rule text or flavor text that seems unclear, please let me know either on [reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/custommagic/comments/2pisvg/be_slightly_evil_a_ribbonfarminspired_mtg_block/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hewhocutsdown).
 
For those comfortable with Github, I have a repository set up: 
 
[https://github.com/hewhocutsdown/bse](https://github.com/hewhocutsdown/bse)
 
If you make a change to the .mse-set files, please use the Cockatrice export template to produce an .xml file of your changes, and include that in your commit and pull request. In your commit log, please list any changes you made, as otherwise some will inevitably be missed, as there is no trivial way to do a comparison between two .mse-set files. If you have any questions, use the above links to reddit and Twitter to contact me and I'll try to help.
